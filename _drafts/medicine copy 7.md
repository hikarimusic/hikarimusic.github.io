  * **Hydrocortisone**: Replace deficient glucocorticoid, mimics natural circadian rhythm
  * **Fludrocortisone**: Replace deficient mineralocorticoid to maintain electrolyte balance
  * **[Adrenal crisis] IV hydrocortisone, IV fluids, electrolyte correction**: Emergency treatment for life-threatening hormone deficiency

### Pheochromocytoma / Ë§êËâ≤Á¥∞ËÉûËÖ´

* **Overview**
  * Tumor of chromaffin cells in adrenal medulla (90%) or extra-adrenal paraganglia that secretes excessive catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine)
  * Rare tumor affecting 0.1-0.2% of hypertensive patients, may be sporadic or familial (MEN2, VHL, NF1)
  * Can be benign (85-90%) or malignant, characterized by episodic or sustained catecholamine release
* **Presentation**
  * **Headache, sweating, palpitations**: Excessive catecholamine release causing sympathetic stimulation
  * **Hypertension (sustained or episodic), tachycardia**: Direct cardiovascular effects of catecholamine excess
  * **Anxiety, tremor, panic attacks**: Central nervous system effects of catecholamine excess
  * **Chest pain, abdominal pain**: Vasoconstriction and increased cardiac workload
* **Examination**
  * **[Blood] Plasma metanephrines‚Üë, catecholamines‚Üë**: Direct measurement of catecholamine metabolites and hormones
  * **[Urine] 24-hour urine metanephrines‚Üë, VMA‚Üë, catecholamines‚Üë**: Catecholamine metabolites excreted in urine
  * **[CT/MRI] Adrenal mass, heterogeneous enhancement**: Tumor visualization in adrenal gland or extra-adrenal locations
  * **[MIBG scan, PET scan] Uptake in tumor**: Functional imaging using catecholamine analogs
* **Management**
  * **Alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin)**: Block Œ±-adrenergic receptors to control hypertension, must be started before Œ≤-blockers
  * **Beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol)**: Block Œ≤-adrenergic receptors for heart rate control, added after Œ±-blockade established
  * **Surgical resection (laparoscopic adrenalectomy)**: Complete tumor removal is curative treatment, after preoperative preparation
  * **[Hypertensive crisis] IV nicardipine, esmolol**: Immediate blood pressure and heart rate control during catecholamine surge
