### Nonhemolytic Anemia / 非溶血性貧血

* **Iron deficiency anemia**
  * Concept: The most common type of anemia globally, caused by inadequate iron to synthesize hemoglobin.
  * Pathogenesis: Results from inadequate dietary intake, absorption issues, or blood loss leading to depleted iron stores and decreased hemoglobin synthesis.
  * Morphology: Microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells.
  * Clinical: Symptoms include fatigue, pallor, weakness, and in severe cases, spoon-shaped nails and pica.
* **Anemia of chronic disease**
  * Concept: Anemia associated with chronic infections, inflammatory diseases, or malignancies.
  * Pathogenesis: Cytokines and inflammatory responses inhibit iron metabolism and erythropoiesis.
  * Morphology: Normocytic, normochromic or slightly microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells.
  * Clinical: Typically mild to moderate severity with symptoms overshadowed by the underlying disease.
* **Sideroblastic anemia**
  * Concept: Characterized by the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow.
  * Pathogenesis: Caused by defective protoporphyrin synthesis leading to iron-loaded mitochondria around the nucleus of developing red cells.
  * Morphology: Presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow; red blood cells may appear hypochromic and microcytic.
  * Clinical: Symptoms include fatigue, splenomegaly, and sometimes signs of iron overload.
* **Megaloblastic anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency)**
  * Concept: Anemia due to insufficient vitamin B12, crucial for DNA synthesis.
  * Pathogenesis: Commonly due to malabsorption (e.g., pernicious anemia), dietary deficiency is rare except in strict vegetarians.
  * Morphology: Macrocytic red blood cells with hypersegmented neutrophils.
  * Clinical: Neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and balance issues, in addition to fatigue and weakness.
* **Megaloblastic anemia (Folate deficiency)**
  * Concept: Caused by inadequate folate, essential for DNA and RNA synthesis.
  * Pathogenesis: Often results from poor diet, malabsorption, or medications that interfere with folate metabolism.
  * Morphology: Similar to vitamin B12 deficiency with macrocytic red cells.
  * Clinical: Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal distress without the neurological symptoms seen in B12 deficiency.
* **Aplastic anemia**
  * Concept: A rare disorder characterized by bone marrow failure.
  * Pathogenesis: Can be idiopathic, or due to exposure to toxins, radiation, or certain medications; immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic cells may occur.
  * Morphology: Pancytopenia with a hypocellular bone marrow.
  * Clinical: Presents with symptoms of pancytopenia such as fatigue, bleeding, and increased susceptibility to infections.
* **Pure red cell aplasia**

  * Pathogenesis: Often idiopathic or associated with autoimmune disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, or thymomas.

  * Clinical: Varies from mild anemia with minor symptoms to severe anemia requiring regular transfusions, splenomegaly, and iron overload.
* **Sickle cell disease**
  * Concept: A genetic disease where red blood cells assume a sickle shape under low oxygen conditions.
  * Pathogenesis: Mutation in the beta-globin gene causes hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen, distorting the red cell shape.
  * Morphology: Sickled erythrocytes with elongated and pointed shapes.

* **G6PD deficiency**
  * Concept: A hereditary enzyme deficiency that leads to episodic hemolytic anemia.

  * Clinical: Episodic dark urine, hemoglobinuria, thrombosis, and bone marrow failure.
* **Autoimmune hemolytic anemia**
  * Concept: Anemia caused by autoantibodies targeting and destroying red blood cells.

* **Microangiopathic anemia**
  * Concept: Anemia resulting from the mechanical destruction of red blood cells as they pass through narrowed or damaged small blood vessels.

  * Morphology: Schistocytes (fragmented red cells) present in blood smear.
  * Clinical: Anemia accompanied by other signs of the underlying disorder, such as thrombocytopenia, renal failure, or neurological symptoms.
* **Macroangiopathic anemia**
  * Concept: Anemia caused by physical trauma to red blood cells due to abnormal blood flow through large blood vessels.
  * Pathogenesis: Typically occurs in the presence of artificial heart valves or other vascular abnormalities causing high shear stress.

* **Hemophilia**
  * Concept: A genetic disorder where blood doesn't clot normally due to deficiency or dysfunction of clotting factors (Factor VIII in Hemophilia A, Factor IX in Hemophilia B).
  * Pathogenesis: X-linked recessive disorder predominantly affecting males.
  * Morphology: Prolonged clotting times and reduced levels of specific clotting factors.
  * Clinical: Recurrent and prolonged bleeding, especially into joints and muscles; severity varies based on factor levels.
* **Von Willebrand disease**
  * Concept: The most common hereditary bleeding disorder, caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which helps platelets to stick to injured blood vessel walls and binds factor VIII.
  * Pathogenesis: Hereditary; types vary by vWF levels and function.
  * Morphology: Reduced vWF antigen and activity; normal or near-normal platelet count.
  * Clinical: Mucosal bleeding, easy bruising, excessive menstrual bleeding.
* **Bernard-Soulier syndrome**
  * Concept: A rare inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency of glycoprotein Ib, the receptor for vWF, leading to large but dysfunctional platelets.
  * Pathogenesis: Genetic mutations affect platelet adhesion.
  * Morphology: Large platelets and reduced platelet count.
  * Clinical: Severe bleeding, typically presenting in infancy or early childhood.
* **Glanzmann Thrombasthenia**
  * Concept: A rare genetic platelet disorder where the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, necessary for platelet aggregation, is either absent or dysfunctional.
  * Pathogenesis: Autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in the genes encoding the glycoprotein complex.
  * Morphology: Normal platelet count but impaired function.
  * Clinical: Symptoms include mucocutaneous bleeding such as from the gums, nose, and gastrointestinal tract.
